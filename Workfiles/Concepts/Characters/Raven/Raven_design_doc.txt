Character description

She went trough hell in mountain pass and considers herself lucky to be alive
Her armor had a lot of modifications trough her journey but mosly expantions

black like undersuit on belly
light armor 



The ideas I got are
white fur specifcally on armor pieces (around neck region?) to fit with the backbrought story of the cold planet at mountain pass (problem with this is color scheme of Raven, so you could try to imagine or see how black/purple/blue-purple fur would work for the armor piece if worried about the color scheme)
a dagger with a holster around her waist or thigh (a dagger she got ahold of with her fight against the mountain pass assasin)
tech like additions such as her wrist pop boy works great because from you've wrote she's got skills in tech
her winter armor may look worn down as its from mountain pass
you could cover up more of her other leg and arm with the black suit or armor as she was in a cold planet
include a piece on the armor (chest or thighs)? that includes a heater? (lol) it would be like a few red/orange bars (could be black when not used) with the criss cross cage in front, you can see what I mean when look up pictures of heaters.
I think an ear piece for communication would be cool :3 or even an antenna on her backpack for coms
a cracked visor could honestly work for this character, altho idk how your lore works for what would happen or what it would look like
tail backpacks are cute :3 (see attatchment for tail backpack)
